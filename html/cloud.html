      <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;Cloud computing is the latest generation technology with an extensive IT infrastructure that provides us a means by which we can use and utilize the applications as utilities via the Internet. Cloud computing makes IT infrastructure along with its services available "on-need" basis.</p>
      
      <p>&ensp;&#9; The cloud technology includes - a development platform, hard disk, computing power, software application, and database. This technology doesn't require large-scale capital expenditure to access cloud vendors. Instead, the cloud facilitates 'pay-per-use,' i.e., the organizations' users have to pay only that limited amount to use the cloud infrastructure.</p>
