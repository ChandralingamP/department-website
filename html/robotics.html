      <h1>What is Robotics and automation?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;Automation and Robotics Engineering is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization.</p>
      
      <p>&ensp;&#9;It is a field of engineering that deal with design and application of robots and the use of computer for their manipulation and processing. Robots are used in industries for speeding up the manufacturing process.</p>

        <h1>Uses of robotics:</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Robots most obviously impact everyday life in the service capacity. some of them are:</p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>Restaurants</li>
          <li>Assisted Living</li>
          <li>Crime Fighting</li>

      <h1>Job roles:</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;Robotics Engineering is considered a high-end professional career in India. There are tremendous job opportunities awaiting a candidate who has professional training in Robotics engineering. A Robotic engineer can be employed in manufacturing plants, laboratories, medical fields, mining, automation sector, life sciences, aerospace engineering, agricultural engineering, etc. </p>
      <img id="job" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581092334247-44dd684e3c82?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8NTB8fHJvYm90aWNzfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60" alt="">
      <h3>1.Robotics Engineer</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;It’s a job for someone who has plenty of patience, in addition to engineering training. An engineer is responsible for developing the robot design on paper. This development may take some time due to the research and the tremendous technical coding of robotics. During construction, a robotics engineer will supervise virtually all aspects of robot development, from security to testing and analyzing and reviewing each movement</p>
      <h3>2.Software Engineer</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;Each robot must have an internal computer-assisted system that operates the machine efficiently. This software design is developed and the code is written by the software engineer together with the robotics engineer to ensure that the robot performs the functions it has been designed to deliver in a safe and accurate manner. Therefore, the software developer has to be very capable in coding for robotics and software design. </p>
      <h3>3.Technicians</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;There are two types of technicians required in this field. A technician trained in robotics can repair as well as maintain robots, and build some of their parts, as well as other tasks.An electromechanical technician works alongside the engineer in the process of designing new robots.</p>
      <h3>4.Robot Programmer</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;Robot programmer’s careers are often very detail orientated, and making one minor mistake can cause chain reaction effects. Therefore, most employers often look for candidates with a degree in either computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering or something along those lines. Frequently the role includes system work including customer support and training, robotic programming and working on robotic wielding equipment. Similarly, often a candidate needs to be a high level robot programmer who has MIG process knowledge and relevant electrical qualifications</p>
      <h3>5.Robot Operators</h3>
      <p>&ensp;&#9;Of course, each robot must be operated and monitored by a person throughout the day. If something goes wrong or fails, someone should handle the situation immediately. This is the task of an operator. Working with a robotic assembly line an operator at all times ensures the proper functioning of every system. They are also needed to use and repair equipment such as flying drones and various other remote control vehicles used by civilian and armed forces.</p>

      <p>&ensp;&#9;The IT and software world advances to the next phase with every passing seconds. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is one such silent revolution in the IT industry that is quite well expected to gain higher potential in terms of both usage and workforce implementation in the near future.<br>Highly focused on the process automation of the various business oriented industries and computing processes that are being handled by the humans, RPA is the new technique for automating all these operations. With the deployment of the right technology it is a process to create automated job works. However, there is a huge potential of RPA growth in the coming future, but is expected to put down on the human jobs as robotics oriented automated tools will then highly operational.</p>
